Yavuz:
simple and double quotes
signal handling
exit builtin
flags and params of commands
fix cd / unset
check permissions of directory for file_in access and file_out access

Andor:
command shouldnt be able to start with | (behaves correctly with | at end)

Yavuz 24/12 afternoon:
- I fixed env (char **argv in the main function is mandatory)
- I added function which free the data list, and function which free env (free.c)
- Now object creation is not displayed anymore by makefile
- I removed libft as a git_module and add fixed libt, add 42 headers, shortened folders name
- In the makefile pls add your own config for your own laptop/readline where the is the if/else statement
- When we uncomment "-g -fsanitize=address" in CFLAGS in makefile we have heap overflow / infinite loop / strange behavior

Andor 24/12 morning:
    -Non-existent filein and inaccessible filein/out didn't seem to be recognized
        so I decided to check for it again in check_valid(), It works now.
        BUT, Looked at (void	is_file_accessible(t_list *node)), there are some mishaps
        - F_OK check if file exists
        - R_OK check if file has read permissions
        - W_OK check if file has write permissions
        (example you check if F_OK and if == -1 you set filein_access to false, but since you couldnt
            even access it it doesn't exist)
    -History works now.
    -main.c 199-203 Took the putendl() out of the statement into the function block,
    because I couldn't compile it (I guess couz I had to reimport libft and it's a void there)
    you can delete this after read.
